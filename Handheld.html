                <h2>Game and Watch</h2>
                <p>The first ever handheld from Nintendo was released in 1980 with the Game and Watch. This simple, LCD
                    screened device was inspired by a bored businessman who resorted to playing with his calculator on a
                    train, seen by Nintendo’s head of research and development at the time. The game and watch could
                    only play a single game at 2fps, resulting in over 60 different models released. The Game and watch
                    collectively sold over 43 million copies

                <h2>Game Boy</h2>
                <p>Nintendo’s second handheld was one of its most iconic. The highly acclaimed Game Boy was released in
                    1989. It sported like its predecessor, an LCD screen, an 8-bit processor, and a new D-pad for more
                    game function versatility. The game boy did have its drawbacks though. Its screen brightness was one
                    of its worst traits.
                    Fast Forward to 1998, and Nintendo released the Game Boy Colour. This new revolutionary model was
                    slimmer, lighted and easier to carry around. Its most distinctive feature was its ability to display
                    colour-56 of them at a time. Both models sold a collective 119 million units.

                <h2>Game Boy advance</h2>
                <p>This next release of Nintendo's handheld lineup had a lot to live up to. To say that it delivered was
                    an understatement. The game boy advance was an extremely generous offer, coming with 2 CPU’s and was
                    compatible with both new games and old ones from the game boy and game boy colour. The game boy
                    advance also introduced shoulder buttons, expanding the possibilities for game controls and
                    experience. All this was topped with an extremely generous offer, being cheaper than even the
                    original game boy. The control buttons and D-pad were also enhanced to feel more responsive and
                    quick.
                    Nintendo next released the Game boy advance SP. This modified version of the advance included new
                    features such as rechargeable batteries and backlit screens, as well as a new slick look-being able
                    to fold and carry around with you. Both the SP and Advance collectively sold over 82 million units.

                <h2>Nintendo DS:
                </h2>
                <p>The iconic DS was released in 2004. Nintendo’s prediction of touch screen popularity led to the
                    creation of the dual screened icon. With new games utilising the touch screen and stylus features,
                    as well as iconic hit games and enhanced control buttons and D-pad, the DS soared to popularity. It
                    also included a slot for previous gen game cartridges, an incredibly powerful processor, and over
                    125 times the amount of RAM than the game boy advance. The 2006 DS lite improved its predecessor
                    with twice the battery life, a more appealing set of colours and slimmer design to aim for wider
                    audiences. This was the DS lineup's most sold model.
                    2009 saw the DSi, another improved version, with DSi hardware- being able to download new games
                    directly from the online shop. It also included two cameras, simple filters and video editing
                    features, being able to browse the internet, play music and browse the internet. Collectively
                    selling for 154.2 million units, this iconic handheld was immensely popular at its time.

                <h2>Nintendo 3DS</h2>
                <p>Although Nintendo had created hits after hits, Nintendo saw their first handheld failure in 2011 with
                    the 3DS. Nintendo’s approach at 3D gameplay and features resulted in it's not so popular results. It
                    could emulate a 3d experience, giving each eye a different perspective, creating a 3D effect running
                    at 60fps. It also ran at a higher resolution, and more polygons on screen, and included both the
                    regular D-pad and a mini joystick. It was 5 times more powerful than the DS, and 32 times the amount
                    of RAM. However, bad marketing and the newer concept of 3D gaming wasn't popular at the time,
                    leading to its low selling performance. Its later models, the 2DS and ‘’New 3DS’’ improved the 3d
                    functioning and pricing. However, after these improvements and huge hitting games such as Zelda: A
                    link between worlds, Zelda: Ocarina, Mario Kart 7 and Super Mario 3D to match the console, it
                    revived itself to a respectable 76 million units sold.

                <h2>Nintendo Switch</h2>
                <p>
                    Nintendo’s most recent handheld, the Switch, released in 2017, was a huge icon, renaming the brand
                    as a whole to the product itself. The switch is what people think of when they hear Nintendo. This
                    game changer included new revolutionary ways to play, incredible specs and popular games to match.
                    It was both a home console and a handheld, was many people's first time seeing Nintendo games in HD,
                    had controllers built inside that could be controlled by two people, had a kickstand to play while
                    on the go, and had an incredibly stylish design. The switch is 106 times more powerful than the 3ds.
                    The 2021 OLED switch took full advantage of OLED technology to enhance the viewing and gaming
                    experience on their screens. The Oled increased the
                    gaming experience by miles, with better graphics, depth of view, colour variation and fluid
                    movement. The switch lite was a lower-budget version of the switch lineup, while still being able to
                    deliver the games and experience as the others. The switch lineup collectively sold over 120 million
                    units.
