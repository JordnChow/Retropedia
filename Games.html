            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Pokemon</p>
            <p>Pokemon, meaning Pocket monster, is the world's biggest franchise. It’s video-game series was produced by
                game freak, and later shared with the pokemon company, and nintendo. Pokemon started featuring on
                Nintendo consoles since its first ever games, Red, Blue and Green. Originally only exclusive to japan,
                Pokemon saw a massive rise in popularity, and became a household name worldwide. New consoles came with
                new pokemon games, and a large driving factor for purchasing nintendo’s consoles and handhelds where to
                play the pokemon games.
            </p>

            <p> Pokemon usually released about two-three versions of the same game for every
                console release, only having minor differences between each version. Over time, pokemon became a staple
                in gaming, and with a growing card and media branch, soar to international fame. To this day, pokemon is
                the largest grossing franchise of all time, and releases new games for nintendo consoles.</p>

            <p>One of the most iconic franchises in history, mario came from humble beginnings as a simple platform
                running game. It follows Mario, and his brother Luigi, both Italian plumbers who jump over and kill
                monsters and obstacles coming from pipes. Nowadays, mario has seen many changes, from incredible

                highly acclaimed by nintendo fans, and continues to this day to be immensely popular on recent consoles

            <img src="Images\Games\Zelda.png">

            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Zelda</p>
            <p>This icon of a game series first released on Nintendo consoles in 1986. It follows the heroic journey of
                Link, a young elf who fights to protect kingdoms from adversaries. There are currently 29 zelda games
                out there. The most recent one, Breath of the Wild, was a huge hit, mainly due to the nostalgia drawing
                old players, as well as new and much improved graphics inviting new players to the game. Many players
                point out that pokemon and zelda have many similarities, being both adventure games with a basic
                structure, but a lot of player-choices.
