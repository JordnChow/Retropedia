                        Nintendo Entertainment System
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text"> Nintendo’s 1983 NES was its first ever home console. It was released during the
                        year of the video game market crash, when many companies created gaming consoles and handhelds,
                        overpopulated the market and eventually resulted in loss. However, the NES was different. With a
                        1.7MHz processor, 2KB of RAM and a max resolution of 240p, the Nintendo Entertainment System was
                        equipped with a huge advantage over its competitors. It came with two controllers, solidifying
                        the idea of a family gaming experience. The NES was also the first console to display games such
                        as Zelda and Mario. All this, as well as a very competitive pricing, helped give the NES an
                        outstanding 61.9 million units sold. </p>

                        Super Nintendo Entertainment System
                    </h3>
                    <p class="textW">1990 saw the release of the SNES, or the super nintendo entertainment system, as a
                        successor to the NES. Although a much higher price, the SNES was the base idea of the NES, but
                        with everything maxed out on and improved. The controllers were rounded and gave more comfort to
                        the user, 4 face buttons, all colour coded, and even shoulder buttons, giving more possibilities
                        for the gaming experience. Its RAM was 64 times the RAM of the NES. Its audio was improved, as
                        well as its design, and graphics quality, offering different movement speeds and higher
                        complexity. Although not as successful as the NES, the SNES sold a very respectable 49 million
                        units. </p>

                    <h2>
                        Nintendo 64
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text"> To compete with the likes of playstation’s 3D gaming, Nintendo released the
                        nintendo64, named after the 64 bit chip. Its unique three pronged controller was questionable
                        and hard to use, but was still iconic. Its introduction of the analog stick also displayed its
                        advancements in controller and design. At the time, this beast was the most powerful console in
                        the world, being up to 30 times more powerful than the SNES, and aided with a relatively cheap
                        price, it was a revolutionary console. It included 4 controller ports, making large gaming
                        groups possible, and harboured some of the most iconic games of Nintendo's history, including
                        Zelda Ocarina of Time and Mario 64. These titles pushed the boundaries and outlined what future
                        gaming would look like. However, all these features were overshadowed by Nintendo's biggest
                        competitor, Playstation. The N64 only managed to sell 32 million units. </p>

                        Game cube:
                    </h3>
                    <p class="textW">Inspired by the shape of the console, the Gamecube was released in 2001. Made to
                        compete with the playstation 2, the gamecube made the switch from cartridges to discs for games.
                        Being 5 times more powerful than the N64, the Gamecube was extremely powerful, offering
                        spectacular graphics and games to match. With higher resolution, 480p, and a unique controller
                        design which would eventually pave the way for modern controllers, it was a game changer. All
                        these features, a valiant effort from Nintendo to compete with the playstation, only resulted
                        with even poorer results than the N64, selling only 21 million units. Many believe that this was
                        mostly due to the competition. As well as the 128 million unit sold PS2, Xbox had also entered
                        the console market, making it even harder for Nintendo to compete.

                    <h2>
                        Wii:
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text">2006 saw Nintendo’s new approach to its releases. Instead of trying to outcompete
                        Playstation and xbox, they focus on creating their brand to be a family friendly-casual gaming
                        experience. The Wii changed Nintendo’s consoles forever. The highly organised, casual and
                        simplistic designed Wii was only 1.26 times more powerful than the Gamecube, proving that
                        Nintendo wasn't trying to beef up its specs anymore. The main selling point of the Wii was its
                        controller innovation. Nintendo was known for its controller designs, but this was completely
                        different. It looked like a remote, and the software interface was also like a TV. Nintendo’s
                        attempt to appeal to the more casual buyer was starting to pay off. With customisable
                        characters, Wii sports, fun interactive and organic game play, and simplistic aims and actions,
                        the Wii sold a whopping 102 million units, simply by appealing to a new audience. </p>

                        Wii U:
                    </h3>
                    <p class="textW">2012 saw the release of the Wii’s successor, the Wii U. Nintendo took the core DNA
                        from the Wii, and improved on it, making it appealing to the Wii’s original audience, as well as
                        more experienced gamers. With another completely different controller, premium packaging, an
                        additional screen on the controller. The Wii U was 20 times more powerful than the Wii, showing
                        that Nintendo went back to jumping to higher specs. Its main selling point was the gamepad, the
                        name of the all new, screen included controller. It could connect to the Tv using wifi, meaning
                        you could play the majority of the games on the gamepad even if someone else was using the
                        actual Tv. It also allowed for dual screened gameplay, replicating the success of their iconic
                        handheld, the DS. With advanced specs, resolution and graphics, it was definitely a next gen
                        console. Although this, by trying to appeal to both the casual and competitive gamer, they
                        appealed to neither. Its design heavily replicated that of the Wii, appealing to casuals, while
                        the specs offered true next generation gaming experience, appealing to competitive gamers. The
                        serious gamers were not appealed because of the heavy resemblance to the Wii’s casual design,
                        and wanted bigger screen gameplay. Although not as powerful to compete with the likes of the
                        PS4, it was also incredibly expensive due to the sensors and add-ons needed to make the games
                        work, making it also unappealing to the casuals. Selling less than 13 million units, this was
                        the worst selling console in history, and a dramatic and utter failure. </p>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="text">Considered both a handheld and a console, this beast of modern day gaming was
                        heavily influenced by the technological advancements of the 5 years between the Wii U of 2012
                        and the release of the Switch in 2017. With dual controllers, Infinite add ons, games and
                        accessories such as controllers and grips, it was truly a customizable experience. The iconic
                        blue and red joy-cons mimicked the normal controllers, while also capable of being used like
                        Wii’s remotes and nunchuck add on.
                        With incredible marketing, slick and clever design, different models through OLED screens and
                        premium dual tone colouring, it was able to overshadow the only 1.5 times more powerful than the
                        Wii-U and not as great screen quality. Huge hits through game franchises such as Zelda, Pokemon
                        and Splatoon all aided in the massive success of this console, being able to become the most
                        sold console in Nintendo’s history, with 111 million units sold, only being through half way its
                        life cycle.
